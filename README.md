BellyBudget
===========

BellyBudget is a personalized meal planning and budgeting web app that helps you plan meals, manage your food budget, and discover dining experiences tailored just for you!

Survey & Preferences
--------------------
BellyBudget starts with a friendly, multi-step survey where you share your dietary restrictions, favorite cuisines, meal frequency, dining preferences, and budget. Your responses are securely saved and used to craft a custom meal plan just for you.

Meal Plan Generation

Using your survey data, BellyBudget fetches curated restaurant suggestions from an external API and generates a personalized meal plan. It rotates options across breakfast, lunch, and dinner throughout the week so you get a variety of choices.

Calendar View

Your custom meal plan is displayed on an interactive calendar that highlights the next upcoming occurrence for each weekday. This clear, visual layout helps you easily see whatâ€™s planned for each day.
